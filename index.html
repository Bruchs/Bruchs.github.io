      <p class="text-faded section-text"> Hi there!, my name is Matias Fuentes. I was born and raised in Santiago de Chile. Since I was a kid I were always interested in video games and computer systems and I Always knew that my future was gonna be involved with my biggest hobby, playing videogames. After finishing highschool I have discovered my passion for programming, specifically when I started learning Web development at Coderhouse. This experience made me discover the endless possibilities this tool has to offer. After some time working for my own projects I was able to win a scholarship to study Software Development provided by Accenture and University of Chile. While I was finishing my studies I got the amazing news of getting a new scholarship where I would be able opportunity of coming to Vancouver Film School to keep working on my dreams, make video games.
      Today I already fullfil one of my biggest dreams. Being part of the videogames industry. Now I aim to be recognized by my work and create new and amazing worlds for more people to enjoy.
